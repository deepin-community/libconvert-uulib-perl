libconvert-uulib-perl (1.33~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  * Build-depend unversioned on perl: permitted by Debian Policy now.

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Drop locally included CDBS snippets: included in main cdbs now.

  * Repackage upstream source, stripping doc/library.pdf: source
    unavailable. Suppress dfsg sufffix in watch file.

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    when scanning in freestyle mode", so possibly security-related.
  * Setting urgency=medium due to the possible security relation.
  * Update local cdbs tweaks:

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.09-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass over maintenance of the package to the Perl group: Change Maintainer,
    and add myself to Uploaders.

  * Move Homepage to own field (from pseudo-field in long description).
  * Add Vcs-* fields.
  * Bump up standards-version to 3.7.3 (no changes needed).
  * Bump dephelper compatibility level to 5.

    + Major improvements to copyright-check, including new versioned
      build-dependency on devscripts.  Update debian/copyright_hints.
    + Drop buildcore.mk override.  Set DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL directly

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.09-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update CDBS tweaks:
    + Replace auto-update.mk with overloading buildcore.mk.
    + Fix applying buildinfo only once.
    + Check copyright strings in pre-build (in clean target it cannot be
      ensured to run last and thus false positives could occur).
    + Add upstream-tarball.mk to implement get-orig-source target.
    + Add debian/README.cdbs-tweaks to source and advertise it in
      debian/rules.
  * Drop version number from homepage in long description.
  * Improve patch handling:
    + Renumber patches to use 4-digit scheme.
    + Document version scheme.
    + Use patchsys-quilt.mk for patch handling.
    + Explicitly disable the two existing patches, and document the
      reasoning (upstream strongly discourages linking against libuu).
    + Fix double build-dependencies in debian/rules.
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control:
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=cdbs-autoupdate fakeroot debian/rules pre-build

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

    version into manageable pieces (1.051->1.05.1 is lower than 1.06).
  * Add local cdbs snippet copyright-check.mk.
  * Enable cdbs auto-update feature using local snippet auto-update.mk.
  * Update local cdbs snippet buildinfo.mk to use correct namespace.
  * Update debian/copyright, thanks to copyright-check.mk: uulib/crc32.c
    has a BSD-style license. Adjust headlines to mention licensing info
    (not only copyright).

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 04:21:03 +0100

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix watch file.
  * Use generic (but unofficial) buildinfo cdbs snippet.
  * Set urgency=high to hopefully get this into sarge in time (the
    changes are small but valuable).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu,  4 Nov 2004 02:16:59 +0100

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream changelog asked to postpone widespread use of this release
    until it either had "proved stable" or bugs in UUlib was proven to
    also be in this package. I consider 4 months of no newer upstream
    release as a proof of stability, and - sadly - it seems UUlib bugs
    have also proven to be here: Hopefully this fixes Bug#268100
    (failure unpacking files starting with :0:). Leaving bug open in the
    BTS until verified, but setting urgency=high.
  * Update watch file.
  * Add comment to watch file hinting on its usage.

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

libconvert-uulib-perl (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Switch back to linking statically against self-provided uulib source
    (instead of linking against libuu-dev), and drop build-dependence on
    uulib-dev: Included uulib is actually a fork with valuable
    enhancements compared to uulib in uudeview. This closes: Bug#223758.
    Keep patches to link against uulib-dev, just in case...
  * Add copyright and license notice (GPLv2 or later) of included uulib
    to debian/copyright.
  * The current forked uulib is believed to behave correctly. This
    closes: Bug#212616 (if not then please reopen).
  * According to upstream author, compiler warnings are intentional, and
    bugreporter never provided details on the claimed runtime error, so
    I choose to believe there are none. This closes: Bug#160069 (if not
    then please reopen).
